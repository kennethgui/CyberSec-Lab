# CyberSec-Lab
## Intro
Hello! This lab is intended to emmulate a a Security Operation Center (SOC). Just to backtrack momentarily, a *Home Lab* is a sandbox where the user builds an internet-of-things to test out new technology, practice troubleshooting issues, and take theoretical concepts and put them into practice. We will be doing the latter in this lab!

Our lab will consist of "healthy" and volunerable computers. A healthy computer will be the Window Server 2022 and Windows 10 devices that will function similair to your Windows device at home (sorry if you have a Windows device, haha), these devices will have built in safety measures and firewalls aimed at preventing attacks from occuring. On the other hand, a volunerable machine is just as the name implies——volnurable to attack. A devices that is intentially volnerubale feels almost like a bad job, but tools like this are critical to understanding how volnurabilities can be detrimental to a device and its assocaited network.

What is there to gain from this lab you ask? Well, this lab consist of attacking and defending, traits commonly assocaited to Red and Blue team respectively. We will delve both roles of the security event and understand how volnerabilities are discovered and how incident management can occur through thurough network analysis.
